create replicaset yaml `rs-one.yaml`

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: rs-one
spec:
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        system: ReplicaOne
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

create replicaset

delete ONLY replicaset, not touching pods

`kubectl delete rs rs-one --cascade=false`

verify that the pods are running

create replicaset again

`kubectl create -f rs-one.yaml`

it must take ownership of pods

now, isolate one pod, by changing `metadata.labels.system` field

`kubectl edit pod rs-one-lgwm2`

now, it will run on it's own, without replicast watching his status
