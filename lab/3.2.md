ssh to master node

`gcloud compute ssh lfs258-node1`

try to create deployment

`kubectl run --image nginx --dry-run nginx -o yaml`

create nginx deployment

`kubectl run nginx --image nginx`

list deployments

`kubectl get deployments`

`kubectl describe deployment nginx`

list deployment creation steps

`kubectl get events`

      - image: nginx
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: nginx
        ports:               # add
        - containerPort: 80  # those
          protocol: TCP      # lines
```

update deployment

`kubectl replace -f nginx.yaml`

expose 80 port

`kubectl expose deploy/nginx`

verify that service has been created

`kubectl get deploy,pod,svc,ep`

get nginx pod ip

```
kubectl describe pod nginx-cdb6b5b95-mq8qb | grep Node:
Node:               lfs258-worker1/10.166.0.3
```

try to access nginx service ip from worker, it must return nginx default page with 200 OK

`curl 10.99.140.74`

scale nginx deployment

`kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3`

check nginx ep output, it must be 3 endpoints now

```
kubectl get ep nginx
NAME    ENDPOINTS                                                 AGE
nginx   192.168.165.196:80,192.168.165.197:80,192.168.245.67:80   13m
