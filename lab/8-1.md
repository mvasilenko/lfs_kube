create deployment manifest file `nginx-one.yaml`

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    system: secondary
  name: nginx-one
  namespace: accounting
spec:
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.7.9
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
      nodeSelector:          # this will tell use only
        system: secondOne    # nodes with such labels
```

list nodes

`kubectl get nodes`

create deployment

```
kubectl create ns accounting
kubectl create -f nginx-one.yaml
```

because our nodes don't have labels described on deployment manifest,
the pods will be in `Pending` state

lets' assign label to our node

```
kubectl label node lfs458-worker1 system=secondOne
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

now pods must be in `Running` state

`kubectl get pods -l app=nginx --all-namespaces`

let's expose them as service

```
kubectl -n accounting expose deployment nginx-one
```

but port 8080 is obviously wrong for nginx, we need to edit deployment,
change port to 80, delete service, and expose deployment again
